<p> <h4>About Me</h4>

    Hello! I'm Cielo, an IT student passionate about databases, software development, and cybersecurity. I love solving problems, optimizing systems, and building applications that make a difference.
    
    Currently, I'm working on projects like Jiboreshe Library, a Polls App with Django REST Framework, and a To-Do List app. Iâ€™m also attending HCIA Security training to deepen my cybersecurity knowledge.
    
    Beyond tech, I serve as a church treasurer and value teamwork, innovation, and academic growth. I believe that collaboration builds bridges, and I'm always eager to learn and grow.
    
    Stay tuned for more insights and projects I share here! </p>
